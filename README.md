# **OVERVIEW**

This repository is focused on showing my evolution and learning path, mainly through projects and application files to apply and test new features and concepts from my programming studies.

## *CURRENT FOCUS*

I'm focused on learning *JavaScript for backend development*, using node.js to work with APIs. After studying this language, I I plain to learn TypeScript for a more focused understanding.
As a secondary focus, *I'm learning git/github and postgreSQL*, but I still haven't learned how to apply SQL or API features yet.

- [x] class_control.js - A simple class-control program that works with predefined grades and calculates if the student passed or not;
- [x] complete_calculator.js - A more complete calculator that handles more types of calculations, but still with predefined values;
- [x] film_recommend.js - A simple project that shows a film and its information;
- [x] greater_less.js - With two predefined values, it tells which one is greater or smaller;
- [x] how_much_days_lived.js - Gets predefined user information and calculates how many days the person has lived;
- [ ] investment_simulation.js - *Incomplete* - A simple project where the user enters information and the code calculates the investment return;
- [x] number_guess.js - A small game where the code picks a random number up to one hundred, and the user has to guess it, with a small life system;
- [ ] pomodoro_clock.js - *In creation* - A simple pomodoro clock where the user gives the focus time, rest time, and how many repeats;
- [x] quiz.js - A simple quiz with predefined values, used to start applying control flow;
- [x] text_decodifier.js - Gets text from the user and converts it to a Unicode-like format, and also reverses it back;
- [ ] user_informations.js - *Incomplete* - A project that works like a sign-up application, where the user enters information and the program confirms if everything is correct

## *Other Files*

These are files where I test things I want to apply later, such as Git features that I learned recently and want to practice.
